# 21 MERN Book Search Engine

## Description

For this application, we were provided the code for a fully functioning book search website built with a RESTful API, our challenge was to refactor the application to use a GraphQL API with an Apollo Server.

When a user comes to the website they are brought to the home page which displays a search bar to search for books, the user is able to search for books, but if they would like to save a book to thier collection, they must either Sign Up or Sign In.

After a user signs in, they can then add books to thier collection, and they can view those books on thier personal profile page, where they can edit their collection and delete books if they would like.
